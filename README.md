This project demonstrates the impact of different CSS stylesheets on the appearance of a simple HTML webpage.
 By using different stylesheets, users can see how the same HTML content can be visually transformed to create unique designs.

## How to Use
1. Download or Clone the Repository:

    You can download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it to your local machine, or you can clone the repository using Git:

2. Open the HTML File:

    style1.css: Default style.
    style2.css: Blue-themed style.
    style3.css: Gray-themed style.
    style4.css: Unique style with a different font and color scheme.
